TASK-1: Chatbot Development :This project is a chatbot built to understand and respond to user inputs based on intents. By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Logistic Regression algorithm, the chatbot can classify intents and extract key entities from the conversation. The chatbot interface is designed using Streamlit, a Python-based framework for building interactive web applications.

# Festures
Intent Classification: The chatbot identifies the intent behind user input (e.g., greetings, requests for information).
Entity Recognition: It extracts relevant entities or phrases from user inputs to help formulate accurate responses.
Streamlit Web Interface: An interactive and user-friendly interface that facilitates direct communication with the chatbot.
